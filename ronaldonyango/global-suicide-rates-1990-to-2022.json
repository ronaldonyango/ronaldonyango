This dataset dives deep into the numbers, spanning over 30 years from 1990 to 2022, to help us understand the complex relationship between suicide and various elements of our lives.\n\n## **What's in it for you?**\n\n- **Suicide rates galore**: Not just raw counts, but percentages of total deaths and standardized rates that account for different population age structures.\n- **Demographics on deck**: Region, country, year, gender, age group - you name it, this dataset's got it covered.\n- **Economic insights**: GDP, income levels, inflation, employment rates - a treasure trove of socioeconomic indicators to explore their potential links to suicide rates.\n\n### Now, let's talk about those age-standardized rates for a sec:\n\n1. **Crude rate per 100,000 people**: The raw number of suicides, but it can be a bit misleading since some countries have more elderly folks \ud83d\udc74\ud83d\udc75 (who are generally more likely to pass away from any cause).\n2. **Age-standardized rate per 100,000**: This one's a real gem! It adjusts for age differences between populations, allowing for a fairer comparison of suicide rates across countries or over time. \n\nWith both types of rates at your fingertips, you'll be equipped to dive into global suicide trends with a nuanced understanding. \n\nThe data comes straight from the good folks at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, so you know it's legit.\n\n## Data Sources\n\n\u2705 World Health Organization (WHO) Suicide Prevention: https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide (Data on suicide rates and demographics) \n\n\u2705 World Bank Open Data: https://data.worldbank.org/ (Data on economic indicators like GDP, GNI, inflation, and employment) \n\n## Terms of Use \ud83d\udcc4\n\ud83c\udf10 WHO: https://data.who.int/about/data/data-policy\n\n\ud83c\udf0d World Bank Open Data: https://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use\n\n\ud83d\udd0e Explore the intricate interplay between societal, demographic, and economic variables with this rich dataset. \ud83e\udde9\u2696\ufe0f\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F11639428%2F7e9426f266704676003c439d9dc5f342%2Fsuicide_rates-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?generation=1710691281646303&alt=media)\n",
